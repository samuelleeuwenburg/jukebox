# Jukebox
The idea is to revive an old jukebox app that used to be available on the Spotify apps platform (before it was killed).

## Develop
```sh
npm install
# the following three commands each in a seperate tab
npm run bsb
npm run client:watch
npm run server:watch
```

## Build
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
