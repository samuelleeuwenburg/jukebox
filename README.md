# Jukebox
The idea is to revive an old jukebox app that used to be available on the Spotify apps platform (before it was killed).

## Run client
```sh
npm install
npm run client:server
# in a new tab
npm run client:start
```

## Run server
```sh
npm run server:dev
```

## Build client & server
```sh
npm run client:build
npm run server:build
```
